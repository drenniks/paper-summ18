% Basic setup. Most papers should leave these options alone.

% MNRAS is set in Times font. If you don't have this installed (most LaTeX

% out the following line
\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}
% Depending on your LaTeX fonts installation, you might get better results with one of these:
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage{txfonts}

% Use vector fonts, so it zooms properly in on-screen viewing software
% Don't change these lines unless you know what you are doing
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}

% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
This is a simple template for authors to write new MNRAS papers.
The abstract should briefly describe the aims, methods, and main results of the paper.
It should be a single paragraph not more than 250 words (200 words for Letters).
No references should appear in the abstract.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}

\li Here are some relevant papers that studied the minimum halo mass
with simulations or ones that developed an analytical model of the
halo mass.  We will probably cite most of these in the introduction.

\lli Semi-analytic papers: \citep{Tegmark97, Trenti09, Visbal18,
  Mebane18, Griffen18}

\lli Simulation papers: \citep{Machacek01, Yoshida03, Wise07_UVB,
  OShea08, Muratov13}

\lli {\it Note:} I looked at which papers cited the \citet{Machacek01}
paper to look for recent papers.  I didn't find any in the past five
years that used simulations to study the minimum halo mass.



\section{Methods}

\subsection{Simulation setup}

We used Enzo \citep{Enzo}.

\subsection{Star formation and feedback}

\section{Results}

\subsection{Population III host halo masses}

\subsection{Multiple stellar systems}

\subsection{Population III stars in atomic cooling halos}

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Variations in the halo masses at collapse}

\li Halos can form metal-free stars again if their progenitors had
only formed stars that did not go supernova

\li Dynamical heating \citep{Yoshida03}

\li Temporal fluctuations in the local Lyman-Werner radiation

\subsection{Comparison to previous work}

\li Semi-analytic papers: \citep{Tegmark97, Trenti09, Visbal18,
  Mebane18, Griffen18}

\li Simulation papers: \citep{Machacek01, Yoshida03, Wise07_UVB,
  OShea08, Muratov13}

\li We don't have to compare with all of the semi-analytic papers, but
it will be good to compare with all of the simulation papers.

\subsection{Caveats}

\li Optically-thin Lyman-Werner radiation field from point sources \citep{Schauer17}

\li No streaming velocities that suppresses star formation at very
high ($z \ga 20$) redshifts \citep{Tselia11, Greif11_Delay, Naoz12, OLeary12}

\li Uncertainties from the assumed Pop III initial mass function

\bibliographystyle{mnras}
